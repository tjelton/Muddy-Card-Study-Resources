# Muddy Card Study Resources


----

**Rationale:**

The purpose of this site is to compile all of the emails and resources sent to teacher study participants as part of the muddy card study.

At different points throughout the study we will be sending out emails about different pieces of information (for example, optional slides you can include in lectures to explain the study). These should never take long to read and action, but we understand it can be easy for emails to be lost in the inbox. To make things easier, we have created an online site where we will place all information related to the study, including the messages we send throughout the study. We will always ensure we email important information. Visiting this site is not necessary (looking through emails is sufficient), but we provide it as we want to make participating in this study as easy as possible!
