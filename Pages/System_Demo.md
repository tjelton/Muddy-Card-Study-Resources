You can also try our test student and teacher interfaces below. Note, your actual teacher interface will be password-protected. Also, this test system is using reduced compute resources to save money and so it may be slow, but this will not be an issue for the actual study!

Thomas will also be available for one-on-one meetings if you have further questions or would prefer a live demonstration.
