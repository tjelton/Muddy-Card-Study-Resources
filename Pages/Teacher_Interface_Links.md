# Accessing the Teacher Interface

----

The muddy card data for your unit can be accessed from the folder shared with you for your unit of study. If you cannot find the access link, please email Thomas Elton.

If unsure how to use the teacher interface, please refer to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OxoSoA5U8kThXy1zT7ewu-woDGiOtL3p/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short documentation</a> and/or <a href="youtube.com/watch?v=sn3UTHpeldM&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>. If you are still stuck, please don't hesitate to email us!


Different units of study will use different muddy card teacher interface links:

- COMP4446/5046, NEUR3005/3905, DATA4207/5207: Use the link <a href="https://saipll.shinyapps.io/teacher-interface-group-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
- MATH2061, ECMT1010, IDEA9105, PSYC2012: Use the link <a href="https://saipll.shinyapps.io/teacher-interface-group-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
- CIVL2700 (you will have to upload twice, once for the Tuesday muddy card data, and once for the Wednesday muddy card data. e.g., for the Tuesday Week 2 muddy cards and Wednesday Week 2 muddy cards, select week 2 in the interface). Use the link <a href="https://saipll.shinyapps.io/teacher-interface-group-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
